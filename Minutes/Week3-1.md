## Progress since last meeting
UML being discussed, discussing which classes which would best represent our UML. Also realised that we need to make some changes to our CRC cards. We decided to split the UML into three, User input and graphical output, data repository and game logic. Atif and Joshua both went over the UML’s they created. We decided to split into three groups, one for hierarchy, UML and CRC.
